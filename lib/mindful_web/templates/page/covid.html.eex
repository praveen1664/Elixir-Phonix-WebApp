			Dear Patients,
		</p>
		<p>
			Your safety and well-being are our top priority, and we are committed to making decisions that are in your best interest. In response to Governor Andrew Cuomoâ€™s statements yesterday and the current nationwide state of emergency declared by President Trump, Mindful Care will suspend all brick-and-mortar operations effective Monday, March 16, 2020.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Mindful Care team is working hard to ensure that there is no disruption in your care. Effective Monday, March 16, 2020 patient care will transition entirely to telehealth video-conferencing until further notice. This service will be provided at no additional cost beyond your standard copay, if applicable.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have an upcoming appointment, a member of our team will contact you in the near future with instructions and next steps regarding logging into your video session.
		</p>
		<p>
			For new patients, request an appointment on our site and a member of our team will reach out to you to confirm your appointment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please be sure to review our channels over the next few days as we navigate this unprecedented and challenging situation. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stay safe and healthy!
		</p>
		<p>
			Sincerely,
		</p>
		<p>
			Ramsing Pardeshi, MD<br>
			Medical Director
